  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by adding an opaque background to the GraveDetailCard component. The implementation uses a status-dependent colored background class system (bg-green-100, bg-red-100, etc.) with dark mode variants, applied directly to the DialogContent component. This creates a fully opaque backdrop that blocks underlying content visibility. The changes are limited to GraveDetailCard.tsx and align with the constraints of not modifying data structure, props interface, or modal behavior.",

      "description": "Status-dependent colored backgrounds for the grave detail card (green for paid, red for unpaid, orange for reserved)",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states in Non-goals: 'Changing the card's visual design beyond fixing the transparency'. The requirement only asked for an opaque background to prevent transparency, not for status-based colored backgrounds. The original requirement could be satisfied with a simple solid white or default background.",
