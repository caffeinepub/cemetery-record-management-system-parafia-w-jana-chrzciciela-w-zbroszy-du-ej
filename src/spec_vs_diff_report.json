  "summary": "REQ-17 tile restyling and REQ-18 CMS-style editing support for Prayer and Our cemetery appear implemented (new tile component + palette variables; admin content manager fields; backend persistent `cemeteryInformation`). However, REQ-15/REQ-16 are only partially met because the public homepage still renders Search (and Map via tabs) content by default, meaning Map/Search are not exclusively accessed via the tiles and the tiles are not the sole primary entry points.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Update the public homepage so the four main navigation tiles (Map, Search, Prayer for the deceased, Our cemetery) are the single, primary entry points to their corresponding sections, with no duplicate call-to-action buttons on the homepage for Map or Search.",
      "reason": "The homepage still renders the Search/Map section UI (tabs with full Search/Map content) directly on the page regardless of tile clicks (Search is active by default). This contradicts the 'single, primary entry points' / 'no duplicate CTA' intent because Map/Search access is available outside the tiles.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/PublicPage.tsx (activeTab initialized to 'search'; TabsContent for search/map always rendered under tiles)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-16",
      "requirement": "Implement the tile interaction behavior on the public homepage: clicking each tile must open the corresponding full section view. Map and Search must open their full views; Prayer and Our cemetery must render only after clicking their tiles and must not be visible by default on initial homepage load.",
      "reason": "Prayer and Our cemetery are gated by `showPrayer`/`showAbout` and therefore hidden by default, but Search (and the tab container for Search/Map) is shown immediately on initial load due to `activeTab` defaulting to 'search' and Tabs being rendered unconditionally. This undermines the 'click-to-open' behavior for Search (and arguably Map) as primary views.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/PublicPage.tsx (useState('search'); TabsContent value='search' always present; tiles only scroll to tabsRef)"
