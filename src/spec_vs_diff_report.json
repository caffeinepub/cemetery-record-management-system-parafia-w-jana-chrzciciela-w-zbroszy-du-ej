  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all three requirements. A new GraveDetailCard component was created that displays grave details with color-coded payment status backgrounds. The component is integrated into both GraveTileMap (for tile clicks) and GraveResultsList (for search result clicks). Hover tooltip behavior on grave tiles is preserved. All acceptance criteria are met.",

      "description": "Payment status messages are in Polish ('Dziękujemy za opłacenie grobu' and 'Prosimy o uregulowanie opłaty za grób') instead of English as specified in REQ-2",
      "reason": "REQ-2 specifies exact English messages: 'Thank you for paying for the grave' and 'Please pay the grave fee', but the implementation uses Polish translations",
