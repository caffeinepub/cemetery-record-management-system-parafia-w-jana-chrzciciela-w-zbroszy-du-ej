The Dialog/DialogContent component structure is visible, which typically includes a built-in close button. However, the diff is truncated and does not show the complete implementation details of whether a duplicate close button was actually removed. The other modified files (frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json) are documentation/metadata changes that don't contain implementation evidence.",
