# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the transparent grave detail card overlay so that underlying page content doesn't show through.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an opaque background to the GraveDetailCard modal component to block visibility of underlying page elements

**User-visible outcome:** When viewing grave details from the map or search results, the detail card displays with a solid background that prevents text and elements from the page behind from showing through, ensuring clear readability of grave information.
