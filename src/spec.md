# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a detailed grave card view that displays comprehensive grave information when clicking on graves, with color-coded payment status visualization.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a detailed grave card component that opens when clicking a grave tile or search result
- Display deceased names, dates, and grave location on the card
- Show payment status with color-coded backgrounds: green for paid graves with "Thank you for paying for the grave" message, red for unpaid graves with "Please pay the grave fee" message, and orange for reserved graves
- Add a close/dismiss mechanism for the card
- Preserve existing hover tooltip behavior on grave tiles

**User-visible outcome:** Users can click on any grave tile or search result to view detailed information in a persistent card with clear visual indication of payment status through color-coded backgrounds and messages.
